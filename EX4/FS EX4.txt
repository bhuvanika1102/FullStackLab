This is a JSON object representing a post. In this case, it corresponds to the post with id 1 on the JSONPlaceholder API. The properties include:

userId: The user ID associated with the post.
id: The unique identifier of the post.
title: The title of the post.
body: The content or body of the post.
The script you ran (httpRequest.js) uses the Axios library to make a GET request to the specified API URL (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1). The response from the API is then logged to the console

In this example:

The urlString variable contains the URL that you want to parse.
The url.parse() method is used to parse the URL into a URL object.
The URL object contains properties like protocol, host, port, pathname, query, and hash.
The console.log statements display the original URL, the parsed URL object, and individual components of the URL.

port: The port specified in the URL (8080).
hostname: The host name without the port (www.example.com).
