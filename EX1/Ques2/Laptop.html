        <p>A laptop is a personal computer that can be easily moved and used in a variety of locations. Most laptops are designed to have all of the functionality of a desktop computer, which means they can generally run the same software and open the same types of files.
		The laptops are used in homes for many purposes. People use them to access their social networks, banking platforms, raise family budgets, make payments, find all kinds of information, store and edit audio-visual content and watch movies online on entertainment platforms such as Netflix and play video games
		American computer scientist Alan Kay is credited with first prototyping a laptop. In 1968 Kay designed a portable computer he called the Dynabook, which he envisioned as a child-friendly device weighing no more than two pounds.
		You can use it to look around on the internet, write letters or play games, play music or movies, and much more. But unlike a desktop computer, a laptop computer is small, light and has a battery inside, so you can carry it around and use it just about anywhere.
